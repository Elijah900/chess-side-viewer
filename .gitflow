# Chess Side Viewer Git Flow

## Branch Structure
- main: Stable production code
- develop: Integration branch for features
- feature/*: New features (branch from develop)
- bugfix/*: Bug fixes (branch from develop)
- release/*: Release preparation (branch from develop)

## Workflow
1. Create feature branch from develop: git checkout -b feature/name develop
2. Work on feature
3. Merge back to develop: git checkout develop && git merge --no-ff feature/name
4. Delete feature branch: git branch -d feature/name
5. When ready for release, create release branch: git checkout -b release/version develop
6. Finalize release
7. Merge to main and develop: git checkout main && git merge --no-ff release/version
8. Tag the release: git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Version X.Y.Z"
9. Delete release branch: git branch -d release/version
